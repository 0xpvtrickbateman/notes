üìù Meeting Notes
- Topic Title: Current Data Checks and Opportunities for Improvement
  - Description:
    - Existing checks include crosswalks (e.g., office code validation), scope filtering, and logic aligned with RepDAS.
    - Conditional aggregate checks across buckets (pending, receipts, denials, hours) to flag out-of-range values.
    - Use of unique IDs and comparisons by office, region, and buckets (completions, receipts).
    - Suggested rule-based logic to reduce false positives (e.g., prior month-end pending equals current month beginning pending; transfers vary month-to-month).
    - Automation could complete the ‚Äúfinal check‚Äù in ~30 minutes if data is clean; time increases when investigating anomalies or validating with stakeholders.
  - Conclusion:
    - The team supports enhancing rule-based logic and automating final checks; the bottleneck is investigation time when anomalies appear.
- Topic Title: ETL Process Consolidation into Databricks
  - Description:
    - Several processing steps currently occur outside Databricks due to decommissioning of BenefitSmart/OBIEE Smart and legacy dependencies.
    - Civil Surgeon and ACMS queries are replicated; SRMT logic exists but needs field mapping and formatting in Databricks.
    - XML queries from Smart were saved in SOP and can be leveraged to recreate logic.
    - Internal SRMT datasets and data architecture are mature and can be leveraged; the team has prior work with NBC to move Civil Surgeon SQL Server data to Databricks.
    - Macros generate monthly office-level Excel exports (with totals) posted to ECN; these could be recreated in Databricks (including SFTP/email distribution and possibly embedded Excel formulas).
  - Conclusion:
    - The primary ETL gap is SRMT refinement/mapping in Databricks; other components (Civil Surgeon, ACMS) are working. The team is open to moving exports and distribution fully into Databricks.
- Topic Title: Manual ‚ÄúDetaily‚Äù Data Collection and Potential System Source
  - Description:
    - A SharePoint list captures monthly detaily counts (in/out) from SPOT/STOPS; currently manual and may be incomplete.
    - Belief that details are recorded via forms and SF-50 updates; potential to pull from an authoritative system (referenced as FFMS/FFMF).
    - Manual effort was ~30 minutes/month when performed; currently not integrated into the process.
    - Desire to remove manual office updates and source data directly from systems.
  - Conclusion:
    - The team will research the system of record to replace manual SharePoint capture and eliminate the process if feasible.
- Topic Title: Historical PRT Reporting Requests
  - Description:
    - Requests received (SCOPS, Edelman from FOD) for historical PRT reports, despite availability in Databricks.
    - Users rely on downloadable spreadsheets and local calculations tied to feeder forms.
  - Conclusion:
    - Need to assess how to provide historical PRT data access that aligns with user workflows (potentially automated spreadsheet delivery).
- Topic Title: E-22 Visualization and Need for Interactive Planning Tools
  - Description:
    - Offices discontinued Tableau/SAS dashboards due to lack of interactivity compared to legacy IMATS (which had multi-tab spreadsheets with forecast/goal calculations).
    - Example use case: adjust future completions to see impact on goals (e.g., target 4.0, current 2.9 or 6.0 scenarios).
    - Users prefer downloadable spreadsheets with formulas; some build their own from PRT feeder forms (e.g., Daniel Koski).
    - Idea: Databricks-based dashboard or automated templated spreadsheets allowing users to adjust production/staffing for future months.
    - Feature to move data from Tableau to Databricks exists but was previously not licensed; may be revisited.
  - Conclusion:
    - Opportunity to provide interactive planning via Databricks jobs delivering formula-enabled templates or dashboards supporting user-adjustable scenarios.
- Topic Title: Data Variance Log for E-22 vs. Other Dashboards
  - Description:
    - Frequent questions about differences between E-22, personal queries, and other dashboards (WARN, FOD).
    - Causes include different date fields (mail-in vs. receipt), exceptions/filters, policy changes, PRT line changes (consolidations), caps (e.g., I-129), and system/query changes.
    - Proposed: a living log documenting these differences, changes, and policies for transparency.
  - Conclusion:
    - The team supports creating a variance and change log to clarify discrepancies across reports.
- Topic Title: EAM Documentation Format Feedback
  - Description:
    - EAM moved from a ~95+ page Word doc to OneNote; FOD disliked the OneNote format.
    - Issues: OneNote search unreliability/latency; fewer examples; difficulty finding content; preference for personal copies.
    - A survey was started but not completed.
  - Conclusion:
    - Need to revisit the EAM format and usability; plan to gather feedback via a survey and consider alternatives to OneNote.
- Topic Title: Deduction Data Consolidation Post-IMATS
  - Description:
    - With IMATS sunset, no need to maintain deductions across multiple separate tables.
    - Requests exist to use deduction data; some currently on staging.
    - Aim to consolidate for easier management and potential external access.
  - Conclusion:
    - The team will plan consolidation of deduction data and clarify access needs.
- Topic Title: PMO Engagement and Resourcing
  - Description:
    - Next steps include coordinating with PMO for quarterly goals; the timeline may need adjustment beyond Thursday.
    - Suggestion to use PM practices: define epics, prioritize, and write stories.
    - Resource considerations: leverage Terry and Christine; Nate‚Äôs team is two people currently.
  - Conclusion:
    - Proceed to draft PM artifacts and schedule with PMO; align resources across teams.
üìÖ Next Arrangements
-  Send the meeting materials and documentation to [Josh].
-  Investigate sourcing detaily data from FFMS/FFMF (or the appropriate system) to replace manual SharePoint updates; outline data model and cadence.
-  Refine and map SRMT ETL in Databricks using existing logic and internal datasets; recreate Smart XML logic as needed.
-  Evaluate Databricks jobs to generate and distribute templated spreadsheets with embedded formulas (SFTP/email).
-  Assess licensing/feature availability to move Tableau data to Databricks and determine viability and cost-benefit.
-  Draft a data variance/change log explaining E-22 vs. WARN/FOD differences, policy changes, and PRT line updates; define governance.
-  Resume and complete the EAM user survey; propose a more usable documentation format than OneNote.
-  Plan consolidation of deduction data tables; inventory current tables, define target schema, and access patterns.
-  Set up a PMO session; draft epics and stories for prioritization; align resources (Terry, Christine, Nate‚Äôs team).

üí° AI Suggestions
AI Suggestions
AI has identified the following issues that were not concluded in the meeting or lack clear action items; please pay attention:
1. Define the authoritative system for detaily data (confirm whether FFMS/FFMF is correct and accessible, and outline the data model and cadence).
2. Specify the minimum interactive features required for E-22 planning (e.g., adjustable completions, staffing inputs, goal recalculation) to guide solution design.
3. Confirm licensing/feature availability for Tableau-to-Databricks integration and evaluate costs vs. benefits.
4. Establish governance and versioning for the data variance log (owners, update frequency, change categories).
5. Scope and sequence deduction data consolidation (current table inventory, target schema, migration plan, stakeholder access needs).
