Short answer: yes—there are a couple of genuine time-savers in that convo. Most of the rest is coordination/governance (useful, but not a big time delta by itself).

Where you can save a lot of time
	•	Consolidating “deduction data types” from multiple tables (Amber @ 00:30:10)
Big impact. Fewer tables = fewer joins, fewer duplicated transforms, fewer staging vs. prod mismatches, and simpler access for requestors. This typically cuts ETL maintenance and ad-hoc query time meaningfully.
	•	Templated spreadsheets with baked-in formulas, auto-filled by the platform (Josh @ 00:31:31)
If you move from hand-built/hand-sent sheets to programmatically filling a locked template (Databricks/Power Apps → Excel/CSV with formulas preserved), you eliminate recurring manual prep, formula drift, and back-and-forth. This is a classic “set it once, reap every cycle” win.
	•	Unblocking/redirecting SRMT pipelines to internal databases (Josh @ 00:11:06)
If SRMT is the last ETL gap in Databricks and you can either (a) get DBIS to finalize the refinement or (b) switch to internal DB sources for SRMT/CDO, you remove a cross-team dependency that likely causes wait time and handoffs. That’s throughput—not just runtime—saved.

Likely not large time savers (still good hygiene)
	•	Replicating a query/setup (Adam @ 00:10:54) → helpful, but marginal.
	•	PMO alignment + writing epics/stories (Nate/Josh @ 00:33:07) → improves clarity and reduces thrash, but the savings are indirect.
	•	Adding detailed data from FFMF and sharing docs (Amber @ 00:34:11) → necessary next steps, not a time multiplier by itself.

Turn the ideas into bankable savings (next steps)
	•	Data model consolidation (deductions)
	•	Deliverable: one canonical table + deprecation plan for the duplicates.
	•	Measure: # of transforms touched per change, average query build time for requestors before/after.
	•	Spreadsheet automation
	•	Deliverable: one locked Excel template with formulas; job fills only input ranges and distributes automatically.
	•	Measure: prep time per cycle; # of formula-related defects.
	•	SRMT unblock
	•	Deliverable: either finalized DBIS refinement or a documented switch to the internal DB path with creds/policies.
	•	Measure: lead time from request → data available; # of handoffs.

If you want, I can turn those three into JIRA epics with acceptance criteria and quick ROI metrics you can hand PMO.
