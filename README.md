The OCDO OPQ Business Intelligence Branch is responsible for executing the USCIS Data Strategy, promoting the management and utility of data as an asset, building a data-driven culture, and facilitating data governance across the immigration system. The teams within the branch use various software and services to transform raw data into meaningful insights, revealing trends, patterns, and actionable information to support data-driven decision-making processes. By collecting, integrating, analyzing, and presenting business information, the teams help members across the organization make informed business decisions faster than ever before. 

Data Engineering Team (DE) / Backend Dataset Curation Program (BDCP): This team within the BI branch is responsible for maintaining a large part of the data architecture that supports the needs of the division as well as the storage, retrieval, and analysis of data. This team ensures that data is accurate, accessible, and secure, enabling the BI team to analyze and report on it effectively.
BI Frontend Development Team (DSP): This team specializes in data visualization and reporting. They utilize Tableau, a leading data visualization tool, to transform complex data into easy-to-understand, interactive dashboards. This team’s work enables stakeholders to intuitively interact with the data and make informed business decisions.
E-22 / IMAPS Development Team: This team specializes in reporting and analytics on officer productivity to support workload planning, resource allocation, and performance management. IMAPS, quite simply, enables USCIS management to understand how long it takes an adjudicator to complete a case. On the individual level, this information is not so electrifying; but, across the agency, where thousands of staff adjudicate tens-of-thousands of cases per day, the implications are obviously enormous. IMAPS already enables improved workload planning, resource allocation, and performance management. Modernizing IMAPS to ensure better, more accurate information will increase productivity and help us address the agency’s current backlog elimination efforts, through smarter planning and tracking of progress.
