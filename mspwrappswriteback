Executive Summary

The Power Apps write-back feature enables users to create interactive applications that can both read from and write data back to various data sources including SharePoint lists, SQL databases, and Dataverse tables. This capability is essential for creating data validation workflows, approval processes, and interactive dashboards that complement our existing Databricks and Tableau infrastructure.
Unlike Tableau's write-back extensions which require additional licensing and configuration, Power Apps provides native write-back functionality through its connector architecture, making it an ideal solution for USCIS data operations requiring user input and data updates.
Overview and Architecture

What is Power Apps Write-Back?

Power Apps write-back refers to the capability of Power Apps applications to:
• Read data from connected data sources
• Display data in interactive forms and galleries
• Capture user input through various controls
• Validate data before submission
• Write modified or new data back to the source system
• Trigger workflows and notifications upon data changes

2. Click "Add data"

3. Search for "SharePoint"

4. Choose "SharePoint" connector

5. Enter SharePoint site URL

Example: Validation Checklist Application

Scenario

Create a data quality validation checklist for Databricks pipeline outputs before they're consumed by Tableau dashboards.
Implementation Steps

Step 1: Create SharePoint List

Navigate to SharePoint site and create a new list called "Pipeline_Validation_Checklist" with the following columns:
Column Name
Type
Settings
PipelineName
Single line of text
Required
RunDate
Date and Time
Required, Default=Today
RecordCount
Number
Required, Min=0
NullCheckPassed
Yes/No
Default=No
SchemaValidated
Yes/No
Default=No
ApprovalStatus
Choice
Pending/Approved/Rejected
Step 2: Implement Write-Back Logic

The following Power Apps formula implements the write-back functionality for the validation checklist:
// Submit button logic

Button_Submit.OnSelect =

   // Validate required fields

   If(

       IsBlank(Dropdown_Pipeline.Selected.Value) ||

       IsBlank(TextInput_RecordCount.Text),

       Notify("Please complete all required fields",

              NotificationType.Error),

       // Submit the checklist

       Patch(

           Pipeline_Validation_Checklist,

           Defaults(Pipeline_Validation_Checklist),

           {

               PipelineName: Dropdown_Pipeline.Selected.Value,

               RunDate: Now(),

               RecordCount: Value(TextInput_RecordCount.Text),

               NullCheckPassed: Toggle_NullCheck.Value,

               SchemaValidated: Toggle_SchemaCheck.Value

           }

       );

       Notify("Checklist submitted successfully",

              NotificationType.Success)

   )

Best Practices and Governance

Naming Conventions

Establish consistent naming patterns across your organization:
• Apps: USCIS_[Department]_[Function]_[Version]
• Controls: [Type]_[Purpose]_[Screen]
• Variables: var[Scope][Purpose]
• Collections: col[DataType]
Performance Optimization

Follow these guidelines to ensure optimal app performance:
• Use delegation-friendly filters for large datasets
• Cache frequently used data in collections
• Minimize API calls by batching updates
• Implement pagination for galleries with many items
• Use concurrent functions when possible
