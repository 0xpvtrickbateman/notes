  - **Key Points:** 
    - Nate: "Sprint 25, 22, everything's completed. Alright, so we'll start with 25, 23. We have four sprints left for this calendar year, and then I have these four for 2026."

- **Agenda Item 4: Document Review and Budget Analysis**

    - Nate: "Jacob, did you ever finish the document? Because I know I drafted one and I handed it off to you. We need to push that up to the leadership chain before we start on this."

  - **Points of Divergence:** Discussion on whether to wait for stacks analysis or proceed with current document
  - **Interim Conclusion:** Include cost impact analysis with caveat about stacks mitigation

  - **Key Points:**
    - Nate: "It looks like they've got a new API. It's 2.2 now instead of 2.1"
