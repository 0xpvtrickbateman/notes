Ticket Title:

Fix dashboard scheduling logic and publish step-by-step MESH SharePoint guide in Markdown

Epic Link:

UOBI-2278 (Validation and Scheduling Enhancements)

Description:

During today’s stand-up, the team discussed issues with the dashboard job schedule configuration and documentation visibility. The current simple trigger mode does not support a 4-week recurrence. The workaround agreed upon is to:

Convert the job to a weekly schedule,

Add logic in the Databricks notebook to control execution frequency (run only every four weeks), and

Ensure that the step-by-step MESH documentation is published correctly in Markdown format within the MESH SharePoint space for visibility and compliance with acceptance criteria.

Sue will take ownership of publishing the Markdown guide in MESH SharePoint and linking it to the corresponding Confluence documentation.

Tasks:

 Add conditional logic to the Databricks notebook so the job runs every four weeks despite being set to a weekly trigger.

 Switch affected job schedule from simple to weekly (advanced) once notebook logic is in place.

 Publish the step-by-step MESH guide in Markdown format in the MESH SharePoint space.

 Verify SharePoint publication and link the file back to the Confluence page.

 Validate that the updated dashboard job runs successfully on schedule without triggering prematurely.

Acceptance Criteria:

✅ Notebook logic correctly enforces a four-week execution interval.

✅ Dashboard job successfully runs on the intended weekly schedule without redundant triggers.

✅ Documentation is live in MESH SharePoint (Markdown format) and linked to Confluence.

✅ Verification run shows successful job completion and no missed intervals.
