# E-22 Modernization Meeting Notes
**Date:** Not specified  
**Participants:** Josh, Adam, Amber, Nate, Jake

## 1. DATA CHECKS & ANOMALY DETECTION

### Current State
- **Manual Process:** Currently performing conditional data checks during processing
- **Time Investment:** ~30 minutes for final check if all is good; significant additional time when issues are found
- **Existing Challenges:**
  - Previous anomaly detection models found 1M+ false positives monthly
  - Lack of business rules integration
  - No understanding of expected variance patterns

### Key Technical Details
- **Invariant Checks:** End pending from last month must exactly match beginning pending this month
- **Variable Data:** Transfers can vary significantly month-to-month
- **Current Validation Steps:**
  - Office code verification
  - PRT line logic checks
  - Aggregate bucket validation (pending, receipts, denials, completions)
  - Office-to-office and region-to-region comparisons
  - Unique ID verification

### ðŸš€ **INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES**
1. **Replace noisy anomaly detection with intelligent, rules-based model**
   - Build exemption logic for known variances
   - Implement business rules to reduce false positives
   - Create tiered alerting based on data characteristics
2. **Automated drill-down investigation workflow**
   - When anomalies detected, automatically trigger conditional checks
   - Historical comparison automation (pull past year data)
   - Automated stakeholder notification for validation
3. **Time Savings Potential:** 30+ minutes monthly plus significant reduction in investigation time

## 2. ETL PROCESS MODERNIZATION

### Current State
- **Problem:** Several processing steps still outside Databricks requiring additional resources
- **Root Cause:** BenefitSmart decommissioning; some systems not in MPD
- **Affected Systems:**
  - Civil Surgeon (recently brought into Databricks)
  - SQL Server ACM
  - SRMT

### Technical Status
- Civil Surgeon and ACMS: Successfully replicated
- SRMT: Have logic, need field mapping and formatting
- XML queries from Smart saved in SOP

### ðŸš€ **INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES**
1. **Complete Databricks consolidation**
   - Move all remaining processes into Databricks
   - Eliminate dependency on external systems
   - Leverage existing XML queries for faster recreation
2. **Direct lake querying**
   - Skip MPD dependency where data already exists in lake
   - Direct schema access for faster processing
3. **Automated format conversion**
   - Build adapters for different data formats
   - Standardize output layouts programmatically

## 3. IMAX REPLACEMENT & USER NEEDS

### Current Issues
- IMAX discontinued but users still need functionality
- Lost capabilities:
  - Downloadable spreadsheets with formulas
  - Data manipulation abilities
  - Future month projections for production/staffing
  - Visible calculations

### User Pain Points
- Multiple teams creating partial tables and dashboards
- No unified data view
- Can't modify production data for future planning
- Lost Excel connectivity

### ðŸš€ **INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES**
1. **Interactive Databricks Dashboard with Excel-like functionality**
   - Embed formulas directly in dashboards
   - Allow user input for future month projections
   - Enable data manipulation within controlled parameters
2. **Templated spreadsheet automation**
   - Drop pre-formatted Excel files with embedded formulas
   - Auto-populate with current data
   - Maintain calculation transparency
3. **Tableau-to-Databricks data writeback**
   - Investigate enabling this feature (exists but not currently licensed)
   - Allow users to modify and save scenarios

## 4. EAM (ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE MODEL) DOCUMENTATION

### Current Issues
- Migrated from 95+ page Word doc to OneNote
- Users hate new format because:
  - Can't maintain personal copies
  - Missing examples from old version
  - Search function broken/extremely slow (minutes to return results)
  - Processing indicator hidden in corner

### ðŸš€ **INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES**
1. **Replace OneNote with better solution**
   - Implement proper search indexing
   - Enable offline/downloadable versions
   - Include comprehensive examples
2. **Living documentation platform**
   - Real-time updates visible to all users
   - Version control with change tracking
   - Better search performance
3. **User experience improvements**
   - Clear processing indicators
   - Faster search results
   - Exportable personal copies

---

## 5. DATA VARIANCE LOGGING & TRANSPARENCY

### Current Problem
- Users constantly question variances between:
  - E22 data vs personal queries
  - Different production dashboards (WARN, FOD)
  - NPD pulls vs reported numbers

### Variance Sources
- WARN uses mail-in date vs receipt date
- Data exceptions and filters
- Policy changes
- PRT line consolidations (Ellis/C3 merged)
- Discontinued lines
- I-129 cap impacts
- System/query changes

### ðŸš€ **INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES**
1. **Automated variance explanation log**
   - Real-time documentation of all data transformations
   - Automatic capture of policy changes
   - Version-controlled query changes
2. **Data lineage visualization**
   - Show data flow and transformation points
   - Highlight where filters/exceptions applied
   - Interactive exploration of differences
3. **Self-service variance analyzer**
   - Tool to compare different data sources
   - Automatic explanation generation
   - Historical change tracking

---

## 6. DEDUCTION DATA CONSOLIDATION

### Current State
- Data housed separately in multiple tables
- Dependency on IMAX for access (now sunset)
- Some data on staging site
- Unclear user access requirements

### ðŸš€ **INNOVATION OPPORTUNITIES**
1. **Single source of truth for deduction data**
   - Consolidate all deduction tables
   - Simplify management and access
2. **Direct user access platform**
   - Replace IMAX dependency
   - Clear access controls
   - Better data discovery

## NEXT STEPS & PROJECT MANAGEMENT

### Immediate Actions
1. Set up PMO meeting for quarterly goals (by Thursday)
2. Create PM structure:
   - Write epics for each modernization area
   - Prioritize based on impact and effort
   - Break down into actionable stories
3. Resource allocation:
   - Leverage Terry and Christine for modernization work
   - Keep Nate's 2-person team focused

### Team Assignments
- **Josh:** Overall coordination, PMO interface
- **Adam & Amber:** Technical requirements, current state documentation
- **Nate:** PM structure, epic/story creation
- **Jake:** Meeting notes, coordination support

## ðŸ’¡ TOP INNOVATION PRIORITIES (By Time Savings)

1. **Intelligent Anomaly Detection:** Save 30+ minutes monthly plus investigation time
2. **Automated ETL in Databricks:** Eliminate manual consolidation steps
3. **Excel-enabled Dashboard:** Reduce duplicate work across teams
4. **Variance Explanation Engine:** Reduce support tickets and questions
5. **Improved EAM Search:** Save minutes per search query
6. **Deduction Data Consolidation:** Simplify ongoing management

## RISKS & DEPENDENCIES

- PMO approval needed for quarterly goals
- Tableau feature licensing for data writeback
- User adoption of new tools vs familiar Excel/Word formats
- Resource constraints with 2-person team
